# AI Project
## Finding the closest road between two scottish cities

*Viz. the doc report for more details*

This is the repo containing the code for our AI Project. All the code was written by us.

To run this code, you need node installed. After that run 'npm i' to install dependencies and then 'npm run start' to run the code.

By default the code will run the visualisation, display all the searched paths and use the A* Algorithm to find the shortest path. To change any of this, comment out the appropriate lines of code.
